# Job-RecommendationbyAhmad

This project is a **Job Recommendation System** that suggests suitable job postings to users based on their profile, including skills, experience, and job preferences. Using a content-based filtering approach, it leverages machine learning techniques to match user profiles with job postings and recommend the most relevant jobs.

## Features
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Uses cosine similarity between TF-IDF vectors of job descriptions and user profiles.
- **Customizable User Profiles**: Users can input their own skills, experience, and job preferences to get tailored job recommendations.
- **Top Job Recommendations**: Suggests the top 3 most relevant job postings.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data processing and model implementation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For machine learning operations like TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.

## Dataset
This project uses a sample dataset for both:
1. **Job Postings**: Contains job titles, descriptions, and required skills.
2. **User Profiles**: Contains user skills, experience, and location preference.

These datasets are created within the code, but you can replace them with larger datasets if available.
